*This approach is also different from so-called conversion therapy. Indeed, there is
a world of difference between trying to change how a patient identifies (on one hand) and
providing psychotherapy that recognizes that how a patient identifies often does change as a re-
sult of maturation, life experience, intellectual growth, etc. (on the other). This is consistent with
what Finland has recently discovered, that adolescents are still likely to undergo significant
changes, some of which may cause them to find adaptations that render undesirable drastic bod-
ily alterations. Indeed, the Finnish guidelines warn that “[b]rain development continues until
early adulthood—about age 25, which also affects young people’s ability to assess the conse-
quences of their decisions on their own future selves for [the] rest of their lives.” Those guide-
lines further note that it is uncertain whether puberty blockers themselves impair young peoples’
judgment and decision making, which could negatively impact the ability to provide informed
consent to subsequent hormonal and surgical stages of the intervention. “[T]hese factors,” they
explain, “are key reasons for postponing any [medical] interventions until adulthood” and instead
prioritizing psychotherapy for adolescents.

Falwell](https://www.nctreasurer.com/documents/files/dst/states-amicus-folwell/open) Koskee osavaltion työntekijöiden transhoitojen sulkemista sairasvaukuutuksen ulkupuolelle.  “In light of available evidence, gender reassignment of minors is an experimental practice….
